## Proposed Approach (Crawl, Walk, Jog, Run)

**_Crawl:_** 

Proposal: Paper study (manual) as completed previously.  Submission of the paper study to a working group for review within the working group via Pull Request

Applicability: Applies to both consideration within review before moving out of holding repo as well as main org

Time / Frequency: As needed or requested by EdgeX WG chairs

**_Walk:_** 

Proposal: Automation of paper study to include all required data points - scope includes automating the generation of the report (ad-hoc) + use of Community Bridge Advanced Snyk reporting AS-IS

Applicability: Applies to both consideration within review before moving out of holding repo as well as main org

Time / Frequency: As needed (ad-hoc) or as requested by EdgeX WG chairs

**_Jog:_** 

Proposal: Combination of the Snyk scan + use of Community Bridge Advanced Snyk reporting (assumes issues fixed) as a stretch goal

Applicability: Applies to both consideration within review before moving out of holding repo as well as main org

Time / Frequency: Every Pull Request upon merge to master

**_Run_**: 

Proposal: Combination of Snyk scan + use of Community Bridge Advanced Snyk reporting + Additional tooling managed by the Linux Foundation

Note: Linux Foundation offers Sonatype - Nexus IQ to the community.  

Applicability: Applies to ongoing scans of main org. 

Time / Frequency: Assumes integration and full automation via Jenkins as well as the inclusion of go.sum files within all go based repositories
